We have made every effort to provide an accurate representation of our products and services in our online stores. However, please note that colors or product appearance may differ from how they may appear on your screen due to the type of device you use to access the store and your device settings and configuration.

We do not warrant that the appearance or quality of any products or services purchased by you will meet your expectations or be the same as depicted or rendered in our online stores.

All descriptions of products are subject to change at any time without notice at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time and may limit the quantities of any products that we offer to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction, on a case-by-case basis.

When you place an order, you are making an offer to purchase. Built to Last reserves the right to accept or decline your order for any reason at its discretion. Your order is not accepted until Built to Last confirms acceptance. We must receive and process your payment before your order is accepted. Please review your order carefully before submitting, as Built to Last may be unable to accommodate cancellation requests after an order is accepted. In the event that we do not accept, make a change to, or cancel an order, we will attempt to notify you by contacting the email, billing address, and/or phone number provided at the time the order was made.

Your purchases are subject to return or exchange solely in accordance with our Refund Policy.

You represent and warrant that your purchases are for your own personal or household use and not for commercial resale or export.

Prices, discounts and promotions are subject to change without notice.

Unless otherwise expressly stated, posted prices do not include taxes, shipping, handling, customs or import charges.

Prices posted in our online stores may be different from prices offered in physical stores or in online or other stores operated by third parties. We may offer, from time to time, promotions on the Services that may affect pricing and that are governed by terms and conditions separate from these Terms. If there is a conflict between the terms for a promotion and these Terms, the promotion terms will govern.

You agree to provide current, complete and accurate purchase, payment and account information for all purchases made at our stores. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address, credit card numbers and expiration dates, so that we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed.

You represent and warrant that (i) the credit card information you provide is true, correct, and complete, (ii) you are duly authorized to use such credit card for the purchase, (iii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit card company, and (iv) you will pay charges incurred by you at the posted prices, including shipping and handling charges and all applicable taxes, if any.
